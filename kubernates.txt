Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines
into your pool of resources whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.

Kubernates master
 1)managing each operatiion and node. 
 2) checking each node is healthy , pod is healthy ,scheduling deployemnet of pod , controlling replicas.
  
 
 
 -Master components:
 
    -API server : API is used to make communication between two pod or two service in kubernates. to manage all this API's we 
     have API server . it will manage communication between different component of KUBERNATES.

     it isimp component in Kubernates cluster. it is front end component of Kubernates master. we define our cluster in yaml file.
                    API server will validate that file and deploy continer to cluster.

    -etcd : It is a place where you store your password. it is store data in form of key value pair. 
 
    -Kube controller mnager :  handle all the controller that is present in kubernates.
      node controller : it will check wheather a node is created , in progress or ready state.
      replica controller : it will ensure that actual state is equal to desired state.

     it is having many controller in cluster which will check wheather desired state of cluster is 
     equal to actual state of cluster.if desired state is not equal to actual state . controller manager will run watch loop at 
	 backend and bring desired stte equl to actual state.
	  
	  
    -kube scheduler  : it will distribute the work load to nodes in kubernates cluster. example which job needs to run on which node.


    -clould controller manager : making kubenates cluster avaiable to hardware of the cloud. it act as bridge between the 
     aws hardware ( sevices how aws works ) and kubernates API ( how thwy will work).
 

 
 -Kubernates Nodes 
    
	- Kubelet : it is major compont .it is kubernates agent on the node.it will interct with api server and deploy the contaner.
	  it will take work load from kubernates master
	
	-Kubeproxy : it will see the newtwork aspect betwen user and container.it will check netwrk 
	  connection betwee user and contaienr how they are expose to external world.
	
	-cAdvisor : container run time environment. which container we are using example DOcker , Rocket.
	
	- pod: very imp. continer will run inside pod. it will create runtime env for container. provide layer of abstarction.
	       as standard we will run 1 container per pod. we can run many.
    
	-kubectl : its a way of acesing the cluster. it is a command line tool.
